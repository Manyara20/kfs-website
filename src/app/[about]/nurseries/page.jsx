            The Kenya Forest Service supports a network of tree nurseries across
            the country to promote reforestation, afforestation, and sustainable
            forest management. These nurseries provide high-quality seedlings for
            indigenous and exotic tree species, contributing to environmental
            conservation, carbon sequestration, and community livelihoods.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Our nurseries are strategically located to serve local communities,
            schools, and organizations, ensuring access to diverse tree species
            suited to Kenyaâ€™s varied ecosystems. By partnering with local farmers,
            community groups, and conservationists, we aim to restore degraded
            landscapes, enhance biodiversity, and combat climate change.
          </p>
